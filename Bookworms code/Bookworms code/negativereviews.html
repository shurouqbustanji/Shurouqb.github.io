<h3>A Little Life</h3>
<p>A novel published by Hanya Yanagihara. This novel has a clear target audience,
  and it is young adults who are beginning to learn about mental health and trauma; teenagers
  who find mental illness “cool” and want to read self-destructive fiction. Although it’s supposed
  to be non-linear storytelling, it came off to be a messy strange pacing of actions. I would not
  recommend this book to anyone.</p>

  <h3>Man's Search For Meaning</h3>
  <p>One of Viktor Frankl’s most popular work. As a usual hater of self
    help book with some exceptions, this book unfortunately was not one of them. From his
    wording common sense in attractive words to his victim complex, Viktor Frankl did not impress
    me with his “wisdom”. It is one of those books you keep hearing amazing things about just to be
    disappointed and realize it only got popular for talking about real problems.</p>

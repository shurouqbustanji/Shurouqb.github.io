      <h3>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h3>
      <p> A timeless Oscar Wilde gothic philosophical novel, although it was
        written in 1891, it battles problems in society that are as widespread as they were in the 19 th
        century; by the main character breaking the norm of what’s expected in high society. If I could
        take away one moral from this book it would be not to excess in anything as it brings its own
        punishment.</p>

        <h3>The Metamorphosis</h3>
        <p> A metaphorical fiction written by Franz Kafka, the best thing about this
          novel is that it could be interpreted in many ways; the author has given us readers the space
          and ability to personalize the morals taken away from it.</p>

          <p>An interesting fact about Metamorphosis is that Kafka never intended for the creature in the
          book to be drawn out; so that we could all have our own interpretation from our imagination,
          but this wouldn’t be the first-time people go against his wishes; another fun fact is that he also
          wanted all his writings to be burned as his death-wish. Thankfully his brother didn’t listen. </p>

            <h3>One, No One, A Hundred Thousand </h3>
            <p>Luigi’s Pirandell’s most influential novel, delves deep into
              identity crises and how us humans can get so caught up in how people see us versus how we
              see ourselves. It has a very interesting plot with an exciting flow that will definitely keep you
              hooked enough to finish it in one sitting; a guy who gets a crisis thinking about how many
              different perceptions of himself exist, within himself and other people.</p>

<h3>A Little Life</h3>
<p>A novel published by Hanya Yanagihara. This novel has a clear target audience,
  and it is young adults who are beginning to learn about mental health and trauma; teenagers
  who find mental illness “cool” and want to read self-destructive fiction. Although it’s supposed
  to be non-linear storytelling, it came off to be a messy strange pacing of actions. I would not
  recommend this book to anyone.</p>

  <h3>Man's Search For Meaning</h3>
  <p>One of Viktor Frankl’s most popular work. As a usual hater of self
    help book with some exceptions, this book unfortunately was not one of them. From his
    wording common sense in attractive words to his victim complex, Viktor Frankl did not impress
    me with his “wisdom”. It is one of those books you keep hearing amazing things about just to be
    disappointed and realize it only got popular for talking about real problems.</p>
